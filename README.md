LaTeX Lecture Notes for the B.Sc. Mathematics course at LMU

* Based on Prof. Dr. Konstantinos Panagiotou's handwritten lecture notes.
* Notetaking in TeX + creating the figures is only done during the lecture and not edited afterwards.
* Figures are created using the PSTricks Export function of GeoGebra 5, which gives us these sweet sweet Computer Modern letters within figures or quick sketches.

* Using XeLaTeX (included in MiKTeX) for generating the PDF.
